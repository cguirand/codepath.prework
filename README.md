# Pre-work - *STC*

**STC** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Caroline Guirand**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

To improve functionality, I could probably add other features to this app in order to make it more pleasing to the eye, such as use different colors, add borders, etc.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I have never used a macbook, nor have I had one before, but I wanted to participate in this course so I got one. The most difficult part of building this app was learning how to maneuver on a new computer and how to use the app was interesting, I still have a lot to learn on both.
